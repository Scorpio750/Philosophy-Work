###9/9/13  ###Peter Singer
-	One of the most influential moral philosophers ever-	Animal Liberation	- Moral equality is not factual equality		- Suffering	- Specieism is no less objectionable than racism or
		sexism			- The argument that we can treat animals in such a
		way because they differ from us so significantly 		fails in the face of animal experimentation	- LD50	- We treat animals as commodities in order to 		maximize profit		- Factory farms	- Are we willing to do to an animal what we wouldn’t 	do to a 6-month old infant?		- Potentiality?	- Fundamental Principle of Morality: give equal 	consideration to the interests of all beings who 	have interests		- for a being to have interests, they must be 		sentient		- Sentience means that a state of the world can 		be good for you or bad for you		- Pain, suffering itself provides pro tanto 		reason to avoid or prevent	- Humans have a prejudice for size-	Famine, Affluence, and Morality	- “Suffering and death from lack of medical care, 	nutrition, shelter, are bad”	- “If we could prevent something bad from happening, 	without sacrificing anything of comparable moral 	value, we ought to do it”	- If we could prevent famine, illness w/o 		sacrificing… we should do it.		- The child in the shallow pond example		- Does not take into account proximity of distance		- Principle of neutrality with regards to 		space

			###9/23/13###Robert Nozick
- How Liberty Upsets Patterns	- “Whatever results from a just initial starting 	point is itself just”		- Wilt Chamberlain		- Pareto Principle	- No way you can’t improve the situation for anyone 	without worsening it for anyone else	- Pareto optimality is really interesting (a 	fundamental economical principle of rationality)		- How liberty upsets patterns (pattern principle 		of justice)		- Unjust _____ to interferes w/ free capitalistic 		exchanges b/w consenting adults		- What about the case of socially unjust systems	- Illegal immigration work systems	- Experience Machine		- Challenging Bentham’s theory of hedonism for 		maximizing pleasure		- Is it enough for experience to replace reality?		- *[Can we obtain knowledge from this experience 		machine?]		- The Utility Monster		- A monster who consumes happiness		- From a utilitarian standpoint, one should give 		all their resources to the utility monster to 		maximize overall pleasure and happiness	- Constraints and Animals		- Does the difference in pleasure b/w eating meat 		and not eating meat justify taking the life 		of a domestic animal (raised for the sole 		purpose of serving our gustatory pleasure)?
		###John Taurek
- Should the Numbers Count?	- 7 fundamentally important ideas in this paper:	- 1. Value judgements	- What does it mean for an outcome to be better?- For whom is it better?
	- Sidgick: subspecies aeternitatis		- From the standpoint of the universe, rational 		impartial spectator, ideal observer, which 		outcome would be better?		- *Agents, or beings with conscious mental 		states, can belong in circumstances which can be 		good or bad for them.		- States or societies are not agents; therefore 		they cannot be subjects of a good or bad 		circumstance		- Follows in a Hume-ian tradition	- “ ‘Tis not irrational for me to desire the 	destruction of the enire universe only that I should 	not scratch my little finger” [?]		- Kantian claim of objective value		- People cannot be quanitifiably valued as 		objects		- When are we wronging someone?		- *Relationship between what is right and what is 		good		- ‘Agent-relative’ permissions		- Taurek believes that all reasons are universal	- If David can do X, then it is permissible for all 	to do X.		- Anti-additive aggregationist approach		- “10,000 people suffering a mild headache is not 		equivalent to 1 person suffering a migraine”		- Contractionist element		- Maximize the the good of the person or people 		of those who would be the worst off
<br>
---		###9/30/13###John Rawls, *Justice is Fairness*
- Preliminary work that lays the groundwork for his 	seminal contractualist work A Theory of Justice- Social & political philosophy- Rousseau and the Social Contract	- “Man is born free, yet everywhere is in chains. How 	is this possible?”		- How much should we be beholden to our 		government?- Bentham	- Legislatures should make laws which maximize 	the greatest good		- Different from what laws maximize justice	- Develops a theory of social justice, not moral 	theory- Two principles of justice:	- 1. The Veil of Ignorance: a State of Nature 	contract where we lose identity and make laws 	that will benefit my own self-interest without 	compromising other’s interests because we don’t 	know our own position in this society.		- ‘Choose your position as if your enemy would 		assign you your place in society’ 	- 2. The Original Position: the initial condition 	wherein we place the Veil of Ignorance over our 	eyes	- Contractualism: Kant and Rousseau		- Actual vs. hypothetical contractualism		- Hypothetical contractualism (>>> Rawls): those 		principles are legitimate if they would be agreed 		to.		- Whatever people agree to in a certain practice 		guarantees that those agreements will be just		- ^ Pure procedural justice (Rawls)	- First principle of justice: Maximal Freedom		- Develop and pursue a life plan of their own 		choosing w/o govt. interference… consistent w/ 		equal freedom for everyone else.		- Locke: absolute freedom is not lawlessness	- Second principle of justice:		- Inequalities may be permitted but only insofar 		as they maximize the expectations of the 		representative member of the most of the group		- Offices must be open to all based on merit		- No Envy Principle		- Envy is not rationally justifiable		- Pareto principle: Envy of superior inequality 		is not a rational principle
		- Chain-connectedness:	- Nozick disagrees with this.		- Why shouldn’t the best off fare better if it 		only marginally makes the worst off a little more 		worse?	- Problems with approximating Rawl’s idealist 	solution		- Theory of the Second Best		- The second best solution to equilibrium 		problems is radically different from the first 		solution	- Rawls says there is no natural injustice (cosmic 	luck), but that there is injustice in the way that we 	deal with such distributions	- Lexical priority		- You have to maximize the interests of the 		worst-off group
		###Tim Scanlon, *Contractualism and Utilitarianism*- Moral motivation	- Morality is a way for us to justify our actions to 	other people	- Anti-additive aggregationist (an•	util) element	- Agrees with contractualist theory	- Does not directly answer Glaucon’s challenge	For those people who have that kind of moral 	motivation, contractualism is the answer for 	justification	- This extends only to sentient beings	- You have to be able to justify yourself to the 	worst-off individual, because you have to do that for 	every individual
	---
### 10/21/13### Derek Parfit, *Reasons and Persons*-	Prisoner’s Dilemmas	- First person to really understand them (without 	knowing them by name) was Thomas Hobbes	- One line of philosophical thought posited that to 	be rational is to be self-interested, so how do we 	reconcile that with morality?	- Were revolutionary because for the first time 	(1950’s?) they showed that self-interested 	rationality was self-defeating	- Parfit challenges this with Reasons and Persons by 	arguing that not only was self-interest not self-	defeating on its own terms, but that morality (or 	specifically common-sense morality) is.	- Makes a very crucial distinction between individual 	and collective rationality		- Claims self-interest only fails collective 		rationality, but that CSM fails it too which is 		more worse		- ‘Each-We dilemmas’		- Claims that neutralist moralities (conseq., 		util.) cannot give rise to Prisoners’ Dilemmas’ 		b/c they are agent-neutral		- Temkin disagrees	- In PD, confessing is the dominant strategy: it 	doesn’t matter what the other person does, you should 	always confess.		- Thus you will always end up with only the 3rd 		best outcome		- People took this to be self-defeating for SI		- Parfit argued against this by saying that SI 		only satisfies the self-interested account.		- By using the dominant strategy for PD, everyone 		in the situation is much worse off	- Hobbes first saw that man in a state of nature is 	“mean, brutish, short, and nasty”		- Declared that there needed to be a sovereign 		who could “chain their acts together”.		- Only that way could we do what’s best for us	- Real-world Prisoners’ Dilemmas		- Hobbesian dilemmas		- Peasants		- Soldiers		- Commuters		- 5 Mistakes of Moral Mathematics-	5th mistake: the problem of imperceptible harm	- ‘Each-We dilemma’	- ind. vs. collect. Rational	- Bad Old Days/Harmless Torturers	- 1000 torturers, 1000 prisoners	- BOD – each torturer tortures one prisoner 1000 	units		- HT – each torturer tortures 1000 prisoners 1 		unit of pain (imperceptible!)	- Dispersed Additional Burden View (DABV)		- A dispersed burden does not matter as much		- HT case		- Leads to the possibility of intransitivity		- This is Temkin’s rejection on Parfit’s view 		that neutralist theories of morality cannot be 		self-defeating		- Problem of iteration (repeated outcomes)  

---		### 11/4/13### Parfit, *Future Generations, Further Problems*-	Future Individuals Paradox	- Also known as the Non-Identity Problem-	The Repugnant Conclusion-	Asymmetry-	Mere Addition Paradox-	Narrow-Person Affecting View-	Wide Person Affecting View-	Impersonal: total average views-	Can causing someone to exist benefit or harm their person?-	“Not worse than” principle	- “On a par” principle	- Intransitive-	Incommensurability	- Cannot be put on a common scale		- E.g. God’s and our intelligence-	incomparability	 - there is no way to draw a relation with each other		- E.g. the number 2 and justice-	Completeness//incompleteness	- Difference between epistemological and metaphysical incompleteness-	Restricted/Wonderful-	Future Individuals Paradox:
	-	“Wrongs require Victims”		- For an action to be bad, there must be a referent for whom it is bad	- The 14-year old mother		- Is it morally wrong for the child to be born when the mother is 14 than when the mother is older (say 23)		- Crucial point! Who we are is crucially dependent on the moment of conception	- Depletion vs. Conservation		- Real-world application in climate change policymakers who use Parfit as an excuse to continue their behavior		- Difference between identifiable and statistical people		- Problem arises when our actions cause a group of different people to exist	- Impersonal Total vs. Average View		- Parfit raises deep worries about both of these views		-Leads to the Repugnant Conclusion	- The Repugnant Conclusion		- World A – world of people with amazing standards of living		- World Z – world of vastly more people with a barely worthwhile standard of living	- Case of Hell Three		- Hell I: 10 billion people with the worst possible existence for 100 years		- Hell II: same people, marginally better conditions for 99 years		- Hell III = average of H1 + H2		- It would be absurd to bring people in to average the condition- Asymmetry	- 3 levels of quality of life: wonderful, restricted, and zero.		- Adding lives at the restricted level makes it worse for everyone		- Adding lives at above the wonderful level would make it better for everyone		- Adding lives between the restricted and wonderful level (John Broom calls this the neutral level) does nothing		- [confused…]-	Mere Addition Paradox	- See p. 158 graph of worlds	- Problem of the addition of independent people	- Parfit says A and A+ are incommensurable	<br>
---	### 11/11/13### Larry Temkin, *Philosopher Extraordinaire*-	Equality: 2 questions	- Is equality desirable?	- What kind of equality matters?		- Rawls - Primary goods		- Resources		- G.A. Cohen - Welfare		- Amerson - Opportunity for welfare-	Economists only tracked inequality and did not explore those foundations-	Responsibility and Comparative Fairness-	Temkin’s “Equality as Fairness”	- Natural and cosmic justice	- Role of will in fairness and equality-	Prior to Temkin, equality was viewed as:	- Simple	- Holistic	- Distributive-	Inequality	- Who has the right to a complaint? 2 theories		- All but the best off		- All below the average	- Two principles to assess inequality		- Additive principle		- Maximim principle		- Weighted additive principle		- Weights the size of complaints 		- The Priority View – a generalized version	- There is a sense in which it is particularly bad when a single subset of people are singled out for discrimination	- There is also a sense when it is particularly bad when a large group of people are faring poorly compared to the privileged few	- *Reasons why philosophers draw abstract concepts is to give pure, clean ideas without having to be riddled with the trammels of the world’s complexities-	Equality, Priority, and the Leveling-Down Objection	- Leveling-Down Objection to Egalitarianism		- There are some ways in which bringing the better-off down to the worse-off is devastatingly bad 	- Slogan: one situation cannot be better than another if for that 	- Prioritarianism: giving extra weight to the ones that are the worst off	- White lie: why tell the truth when no harm is done?	- NIP	- Absolute justice	- 3 different theories of the good:		- mental state theory		- d.s.t. (?)		- objective list theory	- Prioritarians do not follow maximim principle because they are not only concerned about the worst-off; they are given a greater weight.		- Follow Pareto Principle	- *There are differences between moderate egalitarians and extreme egalitarians	- Certain things can be good or bad beyond what is good or bad for an individual	- Difference between welfare and goodness

### 12/2/13
### Bernard Williams, *Internal and External Reasons*

- Sub-Humean model
- Important distinction in metaphysics between internalists and externalists, and also about objectivists and subjectivists
		
		Internalism | Externalism |/| Subjectivism | Objectivism
		
	- Trying to understand the nature of reasons
	- Plato and Kant are *objectivist internalists* - they believe that there are universal features of morality that come from within us - namely, our faculty of reason.	
	- Recently, objectivists tend to ascribe to internalism, and vice versa
	- What is the source of reasons?
		- Internalists believe it lies within the agent
		- Externalists believe it lies within facts about the world
	- **Kant, The Great Rationalist**
		- A possession of the faculty of reason can able all rational agents to reach the same conclusions
		- In this sense he is a *realist*
	- **Hume, The Great Anti-Rationalist**
		- Reason shall always be a slave to our passions (!!)
		- Reason is used to satisfy our desires
		- Hume believes that it is *unreasonable* for morality to expect of him actions which run *contrary* to his dispositional motivations
		- Also believes that it is a *universal* disposition to sympathize with other rational beings
			- That can still be compatible with subjectivism, because it can be applied to the human species, not to all rational agents
		- Hume believes that you can have desires without reasons, namely, *desires for no reason* (I find this incomprehensible, guess that makes me a rationalist)
	 [Aristotle: the good is what the good man does]
	- The important distinction between Kant and Hume is that Kant believes reason can be used to prescribe moral law
	- Subjective individual set S
		- Without a relevant motivational set, there can be no action
		
		
### Ross, *Rejecting Ethical Deflationism*

- Believes that we can rationally reject theories concerning ethical deflectionary, absolute or relative
- Practical reasoning: accept or reject for the basis of action
- Investigates the rationality of theory selection
	- The *best* theory must be best *in virtue of* some condition
		- the best theory in terms of **truth value** may not be the best theory in terms of **prudence**
- The Cannibal Map example
	- If one state is much better in terms of best outcome compared to worst come, then if there is a nonzero probability of 
	- There is a dispersion of value between the best outcome and the worst outcome across theories
	- Apply *Expected Utitlity Theory* to your remaining ethical theories after you eliminate the non-discriminatory theories via the *Dominance Principle*
	- A *relatively deflationary theory* states that there is *some minor* difference between different theories, but this can be resolved with Expected Utility Theory and the dispersion principle

### 12/9/13
### Thomas Nagel- The Life and Times

- The Problem of Megalomania
	- How people can't imagine that they are insignificant
- Difference between the way we think about ourselves from the *inside* and from the *outside*
- We have been alive for as long as we can remember.
- Kant draws the difference between the noumenal world - the real world, and the phenomenal world - the world of experience, *my world*
- *The View from Nowhere* 
	- An objective viewpoint, observing events in the world from no viewpoint at all
	- This is tied in with our deep-seated search for Truth, because Truth is tied in with reality.
	- There is a tend towards seeing the world in more and more objective viewpoints, in order to understand the world *as it really is*
	- There will always be a fundamental part of the world *as it really is* which lies outside of the human experience
	- Why do we do this? Why do we try to understand the world around us?
		- **Because we can**
	- There are two views of God, the *Transcendent God* and the *Immanent God*
		- The Immanent God *suffuses* the world, the Transcendent God exists *outside of* the world
		

#### *The Absurd*
- Difference between normal absurdity and philosophical absurdity
	- Absurdity in normal life arises from events that occur are incongruous
	- It's absurd the amount of seriousness with which we take our own lives
		- There is a contradiction between our subjective viewpoint of our own lives, and the objective view that we can take when we *take a step back* and look at our lives in a grander schema
